RaspberryPi
===========

My RaspberryPi Stuff

* HomeAutomation is a restfull webserver to turn on/off a gpio pin.
* HomeAutomationClient is a CodenameOne mobile application that calls the HomeAutomation Restfull service to turn a gpio pin on or off
* TrafficLight is my attempt in creating a traffic light
* pi-io-demo Is a led light pattern and input demo. It uses all the GPIO ports including the ones on P5. 
GPIO07 is used for input and the rest for output. I am using a Gertboard to test the functionality.
* dac shows how to use the digital to analog converter on the gertboard
